Everyone talks about being "data-driven," but what does that actually mean in practice? After years of working with product teams, I've learned that the real challenge isn't collecting data—it's asking the right questions.

## The Right Questions

Data can tell you what happened, and sometimes even predict what might happen. But it can't tell you why it matters or what you should do about it. That requires human judgment, context, and a deep understanding of your users and business.

I've seen teams paralyzed by data, waiting for perfect information before making decisions. I've also seen teams ignore data entirely, relying solely on intuition. The sweet spot is somewhere in between: using data to inform decisions while maintaining the courage to act on incomplete information.

## Building a Data Culture

The best product teams I've worked with don't just look at metrics—they question them. They understand the limitations of their data, the biases in their collection methods, and the context behind the numbers. They use data as a tool for learning and iteration, not as a crutch for avoiding difficult decisions.
